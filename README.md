# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Risk-Factors-
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), a global issue affecting millions, occurs when renal function declines, potentially leading to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Triggered by heart failure, high blood pressure, and diabetes, ESRD marks complete kidney failure. Life post-ESRD requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to sustain life.
